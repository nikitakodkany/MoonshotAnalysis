# Moonshot Clinical Systems - Readme
Moonshot Clinical Systems is a precision oncology company specializing in screening and monitoring cancers through blood-based tests. The company was the first to develop an FDA-approved test for stage 4 breast cancer, which has helped oncologists prescribe more effective therapeutic solutions. Moonshot's vision is to end all kinds of cancer by precisely tracking molecular traces of the disease found in the blood.

## Summary

#### Competitors
Moonshot was a pioneer in the category, but competitors quickly surfaced with credible alternatives. The largest competitor, Verity Diagnostics, is a publicly traded diagnostics company that has one of the largest patient laboratories in the US. It launched its own blood-based breast cancer test two years ago through an intensive R&D effort and the acquisition of an early-stage company that was incubated at MIT. Another competitor is Acugen Health, a Silicon Valley startup that launched their own blood-based cancer test two years ago. With a significant amount of venture capital, Acugen has been aggressively marketing to doctors and patients and has doubled its share in the category over the past 12 months. Today, all three competitors have about an equal share of the category, and all are spending aggressively to out-maneuver the other as the technology becomes more developed.

#### Brand Equity Study
Moonshot's marketing team has commissioned a study to measure the equity of all three brands and develop a preliminary customer segmentation. The study aims to model the drivers of equity and explore the common themes each company has used in its marketing campaigns. Moonshot has played off of its bold name to position itself as the most innovative company in the field. Verity has invested heavily in promoting its long heritage working with doctors and patients in other diagnostic categories. Acugen commissioned independent, double-blind studies to validate the precision of its tests and position itself as the most credible and reliable in the category.

The marketing team wants to explore the drivers of brand equity and customer segmentation. They will measure equity through three dependent variables:

- Net Promoter Score
- Sentiment (measured on a 5-point scale)
- Intent (measured on a 5-point scale)

The study includes 18 descriptor variables presented as words/phrases, which were evaluated by respondents on how well they describe each brand. The 5-point scale used to evaluate the word/phrase ranged from “Does not describe well at all” to “Describes extremely well,” with varying degrees of “wellness” stated in between. Respondents evaluated only one brand.

#### Recommendations
The marketing team wants to double down on the company’s claim to innovation. However, qualitative interviews revealed that doctors prioritize reliability over innovation. The market for precision oncology is changing rapidly, and more primary care physicians are ordering the tests, including those who are not working in research hospitals but in community care centers. Financial analysts forecast most of the growth in the category to come from sales in the PCP segment of the market.

Based on the study results and the changing market dynamics, we recommend that Moonshot shift its focus from innovation to reliability. We suggest emphasizing the company's reliable test results to appeal to oncologists and primary care physicians. The marketing team should also consider targeting PCPs more specifically and highlighting the ease and convenience of blood-based tests.

We suggest conducting additional research to develop a more detailed customer segmentation and tailor marketing messages to specific segments. The team can use the revenue tier of the physician's practice to segment the market and develop marketing strategies that meet the needs and preferences of each segment.

Overall, we believe that Moonshot should position itself as a reliable and accurate diagnostic company rather than a bold innovator to appeal to physicians' priorities and gain a competitive advantage in the changing market.

### Required Analysis
1.	Discussion of how to handle the multiple dependent variables (DVs)—should they be consolidated into a composite DV or not? Why or why not?  
2.	Discussion of how to handle the 18 predictor variables—do you plan to use all of them, a subset of them, or should you consolidate these variables into higher level, factor-based brand drivers?  
3.	Which attributes or drivers explain brand equity for Moonshot and how does this differ from the brand equity in competitors? If the management team wished to increase brand equity with audiences that serve its strategic growth goals, which attribute or driver should be prioritized?  
4.	Do certain segments of the market have more affinity for Moonshot than others? How would you segment this market and which segment would you prioritize? Why?
